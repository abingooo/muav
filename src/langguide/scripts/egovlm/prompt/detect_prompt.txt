Analyze the drone control instruction: '{instruction}'

1. Extract the target object mentioned in the instruction
2. Identify the specific object in the image if there are multiple similar objects
    (based on description like "on the left", "larger", "blue", etc.)
3. Draw a bounding box around the entire target object

Return the answer as a JSON array with the following format:
[{{"label": "<target_object>","box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]}}] where:
- box_2d is [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] format normalized to 0-1000
- All values in box_2d must be integers
- label is the extracted target object name

Never return any additional text, markdown formatting, or explanations.
Only return the JSON array as specified.
